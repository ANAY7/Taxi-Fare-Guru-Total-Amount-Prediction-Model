Problem Statement
The problem at hand is to predict the total fare amount for taxi rides based on various input features such as pickup and drop-off locations, distance traveled, time of day, and possibly other relevant factors. This prediction can be highly beneficial for both taxi drivers and passengers, providing more transparency and helping in financial planning.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical records of taxi rides, including features such as:

Pickup and drop-off locations (latitude and longitude)
Pickup and drop-off timestamps
Passenger count
Trip distance
Fare amount
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and other data cleaning tasks to ensure the quality of input features for modeling.

Approach
Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and gain insights into the data.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model. This may include extracting information from timestamps, calculating distances between pickup and drop-off points, and encoding categorical variables.

Model Selection: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks to build predictive models. Evaluate each model using appropriate metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

Model Tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters of the selected models to optimize performance and generalize well on unseen data. This may involve techniques like cross-validation and grid search.

Evaluation: Assess the performance of the final model on a held-out test dataset to ensure its effectiveness in predicting taxi fares accurately.
